    longDescription: `SBDK is a local-first data pipeline toolkit that enables data engineers to build, test, and iterate on data pipelines on their local machines in secondsâ€”without cloud dependencies or infrastructure costs.

Built on industry-standard tools (DLT, dbt, and DuckDB), SBDK provides a complete ETL environment that initializes in 30 seconds with hot-reload development for instant feedback. The toolkit achieves 396K+ operations per second with a sub-500MB memory footprintâ€”dramatically lighter than traditional cloud-based data stacks.

Key features include:
- Complete data pipeline setup in 30 seconds
- Local processing with full data sovereignty
- Real-time pipeline monitoring through visual terminal UI
- Hot-reload development with automatic re-execution
- Built-in synthetic data generation and query helpers
- 11x faster installation than pip using uv package manager
- Zero monthly costs compared to cloud alternatives

MIT-licensed and permanently free for core functionality, SBDK serves data engineers, analytics teams, startups, and enterprises seeking to avoid vendor lock-in while maintaining development velocity and compliance requirements.`,
