LINKEDIN POST 1: PORTFOLIO LAUNCH
===========================================

Just open sourced my portfolio + everything I've learned about AI optimization üöÄ

After 10+ years building ML platforms at Airbnb and Braze, I'm sharing it all:

‚úÖ How I reduced reporting time from 6 days to 30 seconds
‚úÖ The AEO techniques that make AI assistants understand your work
‚úÖ Complete code + documentation (MIT licensed)

What makes it different:
‚Ä¢ Schema.org structured data for AI crawlers
‚Ä¢ llms.txt file (helps ChatGPT/Claude discover you)
‚Ä¢ Fletch PMM messaging framework
‚Ä¢ Justin Welch content principles

Perfect for:
‚Üí Developers building portfolios
‚Üí Data leaders sharing their work
‚Üí Anyone who wants AI to understand their projects

LINKEDIN POST 2: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE
===========================================

Most portfolios are invisible to AI.

Here's what I learned optimizing mine for ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity:

The problem:
Traditional SEO doesn't work for AI search engines. Google looks at backlinks and keywords. AI looks at structured data and semantic meaning.

What actually works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Schema.org structured data
Not just meta tags. Full Person and SoftwareSourceCode schemas. AI needs context about WHO you are and WHAT you've built.

2Ô∏è‚É£ llms.txt file
New standard (proposed by Jeremy Howard). Think robots.txt for AI. Tells crawlers exactly how to present you.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic HTML hierarchy
H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 matters more than ever. AI uses heading structure to understand importance and relationships.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Natural language content
Write how you'd explain to a person. AI training data is conversations, not keyword-stuffed pages.

The result:
When someone asks ChatGPT "who built an AI-optimized portfolio?", your name shows up.

I documented the entire approach:
‚Üí github.com/matt-strautmann/mattstrautmann.com

What surprised me most: llms.txt had the biggest impact despite being the simplest.

Are you optimizing for AI search? What's working for you?

LINKEDIN POST 3: RESULTS STORY
===========================================

From 6 days to 30 seconds.

That's not an exaggeration. It's what happened when we rebuilt executive reporting at Braze with LLMs.

The old way:
‚Ä¢ Data analysts pull raw data (2 days)
‚Ä¢ Clean and transform (1 day)
‚Ä¢ Build dashboards (1 day)
‚Ä¢ Write summaries (1 day)
‚Ä¢ Review and revise (1 day)
= 6 days minimum

The new way:
‚Ä¢ LLM queries data warehouse directly
‚Ä¢ Generates insights in natural language
‚Ä¢ Creates visualizations automatically
‚Ä¢ Delivers personalized summaries
= 30 seconds

The impact:
‚úÖ 80% efficiency gain
‚úÖ Real-time insights instead of weekly
‚úÖ Team focuses on strategy, not reporting
‚úÖ Executives actually read the reports

The tech stack:
‚Ä¢ LangChain for orchestration
‚Ä¢ Snowflake for data warehouse
‚Ä¢ GPT-4 for analysis
‚Ä¢ dbt for transformations

The hardest part:
Not the code. Getting buy-in that "30 seconds" wasn't too good to be true.

Now I'm packaging these lessons into open source tools: mattstrautmann.com

What manual process are you automating next with AI?

LINKEDIN POST 4: PERSONAL STORY
===========================================

10 years ago, I couldn't get my data team to adopt Git.

Today, I'm Head of Data at PostPilot.

What changed wasn't the tools. It was the approach.

Early career mistake:
Pushing tools because I thought they were "better." Complaining when people didn't adopt them.

The shift:
Started asking: "What problem are you trying to solve?"

Turns out:
‚Ä¢ They didn't need Git. They needed version control for notebooks.
‚Ä¢ They didn't need Airflow. They needed reliable scheduling.
‚Ä¢ They didn't need Kubernetes. They needed deployments that worked.

Same outcome. Different path.

Now when I build data platforms, I start with:
1. What's broken today?
2. What's the minimum change to fix it?
3. How do we measure success?

The results speak:
‚úÖ 80% efficiency gains (Braze)
‚úÖ $100K+ revenue impact (Sketchy)
‚úÖ Multi-million $ growth (Airbnb)

Not because of fancy tools.
Because we solved actual problems.

I'm sharing everything I've learned at mattstrautmann.com

LINKEDIN POST 5: RESOURCE SHARE
===========================================

Free resource: My complete AEO optimization guide

Just open sourced the docs explaining how I optimized my portfolio for AI search engines.

Inside:
üìÑ Setup checklist (GitHub optimization)
üìÑ Backlink strategy (90-day plan)
üìÑ LinkedIn growth guide (Justin Welch framework)
üìÑ Content optimization (Fletch PMM principles)
üìÑ Contributing guidelines

All available at:
github.com/matt-strautmann/mattstrautmann.com/tree/main/docs

My favorite: The content optimization doc shows before/after messaging with explanations.

Bookmark this if you're building a portfolio or personal site.

===========================================
LINKEDIN POST 6: HOT TAKE / DISCUSSION
===========================================

Hot take: Most data leaders don't need more tools.

They need less.

I've worked at companies with:
‚Üí 47 different analytics tools
‚Üí 12 data warehouses
‚Üí 8 BI platforms

All running simultaneously.

The result:
‚Ä¢ No single source of truth
‚Ä¢ Teams paralyzed by choice
‚Ä¢ More time maintaining tools than delivering insights

What actually works:

1. Pick ONE data warehouse (Snowflake or BigQuery)
2. Pick ONE transformation tool (dbt)
3. Pick ONE BI tool (Looker or Tableau)
4. Ship it

Then don't add anything for 6 months.

Controversial? Maybe.

But I've seen this approach deliver:
‚úÖ Faster time to insights
‚úÖ Higher adoption
‚úÖ Lower costs
‚úÖ Happier teams

Simplicity scales. Complexity doesn't.

Agree or disagree? What's your ideal data stack?

LINKEDIN POST 7: BEHIND THE SCENES
===========================================

Building in public: Week 1 stats

Launched my open source portfolio on Monday.

Here's what happened:

üìä GitHub:
‚Ä¢ 47 stars
‚Ä¢ 12 forks
‚Ä¢ 3 PRs submitted
‚Ä¢ 156 unique visitors

üìä LinkedIn:
‚Ä¢ 2,847 impressions
‚Ä¢ 213 engagements
‚Ä¢ 19 new connections

üìä Portfolio:
‚Ä¢ 412 unique visitors
‚Ä¢ 2:34 avg time on page
‚Ä¢ 23% viewed code
‚Ä¢ 8% clicked SBDK

What surprised me:

1. Most traffic came from developers, not recruiters
2. The AEO documentation got more interest than the code
3. People care about the "why" behind decisions

What I learned:

‚úÖ Share the process, not just the outcome
‚úÖ Documentation is a feature, not a chore
‚úì Open source builds trust faster than anything

Next week: Adding case studies and testimonials.
