### Fletch PMM's Messaging Framework

**Profile:** B2B messaging consultants, helped 500+ startups with positioning

**Core Framework:**
```
Hero → Problem → Solution → Value Props → CTA
```

**Key Principles:**
1. **Minimum Viable Positioning** - Answer 4 questions in hero:
   - Who is this for?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How does it work?
   - What makes it different?

2. **Problem Section** - Build empathy by calling out pain points
3. **Solution Section** - Show how you've solved it
4. **Value Props** - Specific features/benefits that support positioning
5. **Clear CTA** - Actionable next steps

**Application to Portfolio:**
- **Hero**: Clear hook + who I am + what I deliver
- **Problem**: "The Challenge" section - data chaos, wasted time
- **Solution**: "How I've Delivered Results" - proven impact
- **Value Props**: "What I'm Building in the Open" - open source tools
- **CTA**: "Building something in AI/Data?" - targeted call to action

## Messaging Principles Applied

### 1. Specificity Over Generalization
- ❌ "I help companies with data"
- ✅ "From 6 days to 30 seconds"

### 2. Outcomes Over Features
- ❌ "I build ML platforms"
- ✅ "80% efficiency gains, $100K+ revenue impact"

### 3. Problem → Solution Flow
- First show the pain (data chaos)
- Then show the cure (proven results)
- Finally show the path (open source tools)

### 4. Social Proof Throughout
- Company names: Airbnb, Braze, PostPilot
- Metrics: 80%, $100K+, 10+ years
- Specific examples: "6 days to 30 seconds"

### 5. Clear Segmentation
- **Primary audience**: Companies with AI/Data needs
- **Secondary audience**: Developers interested in open source
- **Tertiary audience**: Recruiters/hiring managers

## Content Flow Psychology

```
1. HOOK (Grab attention)
   → "6 days to 30 seconds"

2. EMPATHY (Show you understand)
   → "drowning in data but starving for insights"

3. CREDIBILITY (Prove you can solve it)
   → Airbnb, Braze results

4. VALUE (Show what's in it for them)
   → Open source tools

5. ACTION (Make it easy to engage)
   → LinkedIn, GitHub, collaboration
```

This follows both:
- **Fletch PMM**: Hero → Problem → Solution → Value Props → CTA
- **Justin Welch**: Hook → Value → Social Proof → CTA

---
