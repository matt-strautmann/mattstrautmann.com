ENGAGEMENT GUIDE
===========================================

Best Posting Times:
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 8-10 AM ET
- Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons

Engagement Strategy:
- Respond to comments within 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions
- Tag relevant people (sparingly)
- Share others' content too (80/20 rule)

Hashtag Strategy:
- Use 3-5 hashtags max
- Mix popular (#AI, #OpenSource) with niche (#AEO, #BuildInPublic)
- Put hashtags at the end, not scattered throughout

Question Frameworks:
- "What's your experience with X?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What are you working on?"
- "What surprised you most about Y?"
