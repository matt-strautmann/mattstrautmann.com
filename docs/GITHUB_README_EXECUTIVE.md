## 💡 Building in Public

Beyond my executive work, I build developer tools and share the journey:

### [SBDK - Software Builder Development Kit](https://sbdk.dev)
A comprehensive toolkit for streamlining software development.

**Why?** After 10+ years building enterprise platforms, I'm applying those lessons to make individual developers more productive.

- TypeScript-first with full type safety
- Reusable components and utilities
- Zero boilerplate, maximum productivity

## 🎯 What Makes Me Different

**I'm an executive who still codes.**

Most data leaders manage teams but lose touch with implementation. I bridge both worlds:
- **Strategic**: 10+ years leading data teams at top companies
- **Hands-on**: Building SBDK, contributing to open source
- **Unique perspective**: Executive needs + technical execution

This makes me effective at translating business problems into technical solutions that actually work.
