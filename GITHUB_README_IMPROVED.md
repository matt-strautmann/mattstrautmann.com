## 🚀 What I'm Building

### [SBDK - Software Builder Development Kit](https://sbdk.dev)
A comprehensive toolkit that streamlines the software development process. Built with TypeScript, designed for developers who value their time.

**Why SBDK?** Because every project shouldn't start from scratch. SBDK provides:
- 🛠️ Reusable components and utilities
- 📚 Best-practice implementations
- ⚡ Zero boilerplate, maximum productivity
- 🎯 TypeScript-first with full type safety

## 💡 Philosophy

> **"Build tools that solve real problems. Write code that others can understand. Share what you learn."**

I believe in:
- 📖 **Clear documentation** - Code is read more than written
- 🤝 **Open source** - Better together than alone
- 🎯 **Solving real problems** - Not just building for building's sake
- 🚀 **Shipping fast** - Iterate in public, learn from users
- 💬 **Building in public** - Share the journey, not just the destination
