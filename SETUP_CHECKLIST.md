**Hacker News Post (Show HN):**
Title: `Show HN: My AI-Optimized Portfolio (Next.js, Schema.org, llms.txt)`
Text:
```
I built my portfolio with AI discoverability as a first-class concern.

Key features:
- Schema.org structured data (Person + SoftwareSourceCode schemas)
- llms.txt file (helps ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity understand the site)
- Fully open source (MIT license)
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind

The goal was to make it easy for AI assistants to understand and recommend my projects. I documented all the AEO techniques so others can use this as a template.
